# Maze Solver
This project is based on the[Build a Maze Solver](https://www.boot.dev/assignments/fb0967e1-a304-4110-8bf3-41071d99af0c) guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).

It is a simple python based program that:
- generates a random maze
- solves the maze using a DFS based recursive approach
- visualizes the whole process using the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) python library
